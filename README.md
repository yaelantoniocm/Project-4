DIABETES AFFECTS MILLIONS WORLDWIDE. OUR MODEL AIMS TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE BY ANALYZING VARIOUS PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND RISK FACTORS TO PREDICT DIABETES ONSET. THIS APPROACH IS NOT JUST ABOUT PREDICTION; IT'S A STEP TOWARDS GREATER AWARENESS AND PROACTIVE HEALTH MANAGEMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DIABETES.

Model Variables: The variables considered in the model include:
​
- HbA1C Levels
- Gender
- Smoking History
- Heart Disease
- BMI
- Blood Glucose
- Diabetes
​

Detailed Explanation on HbA1c: A detailed explanation is provided on HbA1c levels (hemoglobin A1c or glycated hemoglobin), which is a measure of average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. It is primarily used to monitor long-term blood sugar control in people with diabetes and helps in understanding how well diabetes is being managed.

* For the data exploration tableau and Python was used to get a better understanding.

* Most of the people is between 25-30 in Body Mass Index which is overweight.

* In Age vs diabetes it is clearly seen that the tendency is the older the people, more likely to get diabetes.

* In smoking history it was a little bit tricky because there is some missing information and because people were not completely honest

* The people with heart disease was separated in groups so it can be better understood and as the tenency continues, older the people get the more problems they have.

​
Conclusions:

The model using balanced data without repetition achieved greater accuracy, successfully predicting 4 out of 6 tests. In contrast, the model with balanced data, which involved data elimination and no duplication, achieved a success rate of 3 out of 6. The optimal number of epochs for training the model was determined to be 10 epochs and 50 epochs. Also, more information such as other factors like genetics, accurate smoking exposure history, diet, etc., is needed for the model to be even more precise and to avoid making assumptions.
